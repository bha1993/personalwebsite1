Hi! My name is Brian Ha and I am an intended dual major in Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences, and Mechanical Engineering here
at UC Berkeley. I have taken a wide variety of courses here and been involved in organizations such as the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Engineering World Health, and Pioneers in Engineering. In my free time I like to crash social events and discover fine dining.
